---SETUP INSTRUCTIONS---

Just fire up the game, run onto the platform visible in front, select the audio you want to play with, PRESS E at the beat drop

---DESIGN CHOICES ---- 

included in a separate document

----POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENT -----

I could not fully implement the architecture I set out to on account of the decoders requiring some work and then fine-tuning picking up the beats.
The current implementation is already scalable and we can drop as many zones as we want, but the separation of concerns as I wanted to be, was not realized 100%

THERE IS ALSO A KNOWN BUG AT THE MOMENT - where if you exit the zone and go back to it, new notes are not spawned. Given more time, I would fix this too.

I would also work on adding some effects for success/failure and overall visual polish
